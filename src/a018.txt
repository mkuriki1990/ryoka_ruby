College Hymn (1916)
Prof.Paul Rowland

1.
Fair Alma Mater, this our hymn
  Of filial loyalty we chant;
Amidst thy grove of Academe,
  In cloister'd quiet dost thou grant
    To ev'ry ardent earnest youth
    Visions of Beauty, Birtue, Truth !

2.
When this new land was raw frontier,
  Primeval forest, rude and rough,
Thou stood'st alone-the Pioneer-
  Taming wild Nature's sterner stuff,
    And building beautiful the while
    The Athens of our Northern Isle.

3.
Honor her founders-men of mark-
  Exalt her sons who fame have won;
All hail to Kuroda and Clark,
  The boys of '80 and '81 !
    Mother of men ! on grant that we
    To thy traditions true may be.

4.
Soon must we leave thy happy halls,
  Thy books, thy warm fraternity,
Then forth to fight where Duty calls,
  Warriors of Right, strong arm'd by thee
    To do and dare whate'er we can
    For Home, for Country, and for Man!

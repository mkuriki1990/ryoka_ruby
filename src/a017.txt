MARCHING SONG (1915)
Prof.Paul Rowland

1.
Come all ye men of Sapporo,
  Come sing our far-fam'd college;
Our hearts afire with high desire,
  We're here to share her knowledge:
By Ishikari's mighty flood,
  With mountains firm defending,
    Give a cheer, cheer, cheer,
    Four our mother dear,
  Her thousand sons befriending.

2.
Come winter snow and blizzards blow,
  We'll all enjoy you keenly,
And gaily ski and skate with glee
  Beneath the elms so queenly;
With tennis, wresling, fencing, ball,
  Our lusty sports are glorious,
    Then sing, sing
    Till the buildings ring
With sounds of joy victorious.

3.
So when our college days are o'er,
  And comrades true must sever,
These mem'ries old shall make us bold
  To meet each new endeavor:
Our motto, Be Ambitious, Boys,
  Our guide the North Star ever,
    Vive la Tohoku
    Noka Daigaku
Forever and foever!
